"Learning Linux typically involves high initial setup costs, creating a "
"paradox in practice: beginners often must already possess some understanding "
"of the Linux environment before they can effectively begin learning it. To "
"address this challenge, we developed an online interactive learning "
"curriculum with the core design goal of eliminating the learning barriers "
"imposed by manual configuration. Our approach breaks down Linux core "
"concepts into small, focused challenge tasks, enabling learners to achieve "
"progressive mastery through active practice. Beyond traditional exercises, "
"the curriculum introduces deliberately designed \"unconventional\" and even "
"destructive learning scenarios, such as simulating system security "
"intrusions, deploying `forkbomb`, and executing \"high-risk\" commands like "
"`rm -rf /`, deepening understanding of system behavior through intense "
"contrasting experiences. These \"shenanigan challenges\" not only strengthen "
"learners' technical capabilities but also allow them to intuitively "
"recognize the systemic consequences of erroneous operations, thereby gaining "
"a more comprehensive understanding of the Linux environment's flexibility, "
"power, and potential risks, significantly enhancing the engagement and "
"immersion of the learning process."

"The majority of our university's computer science curriculum expects "
"students to possess Linux knowledge, yet prior to this work, our curriculum "
"lacked any systematic Linux education. The absence of structured Linux "
"instruction permeated and constrained students throughout their computer "

"This paper introduces a novel platform we developed to address this problem: "
"the Linux Luminarium. Inspired by the rise of a new paradigm in "
"cybersecurity education in 2024 \\[[17](references.md#ref17)\\], we designed "
"and implemented the Linux Luminarium, a turnkey, well-structured, "
"challenge-driven Linux learning platform. The Linux Luminarium contains 108 "
"challenges distributed across 15 subject modules, with content ranging from "
"learning command-line concepts to advanced exploration of the Linux security "
"model."

"To maximize learning effectiveness, the Linux Luminarium introduces multiple "
"innovative features not found in other Linux education platforms, including "
"deep shell-based instrumentation mechanisms that provide real-time guidance "

"We opened the Linux Luminarium to the public on May 1, 2024. As of July 1, "
"2025, the platform has provided learning support to 15,394 learners "
"(including both students from our university and external users) and has "
"cumulatively completed 697,553 challenges. We also deployed the Linux "
"Luminarium as an instructional module in a required junior-year computer "
"science course at our university. According to observational feedback from "
"the teaching process, Linux-related learning issues in subsequent coursework "
"have significantly decreased."

"To evaluate the educational effectiveness of the Linux Luminarium, we "
"conducted two surveys (both reviewed by our Institutional Review Board and "
"determined to be Exempt). One survey collected feedback from 47 external "
"learners, while the other was directed at 405 junior-year computer science "
"students at our university. The results from both surveys consistently "
"demonstrate that the Linux Luminarium is an effective teaching tool, not "
"only addressing the frustration learners commonly experienced when learning "
"Linux prior to using the Linux Luminarium, but also significantly improving "
"their Linux-related knowledge levels. Additionally, the survey results "
"indicate that the innovative design elements we proposed played a critical "

"**Minimal Hardware Requirements.** We wanted to make it accessible to people "
"from diverse backgrounds, including those who cannot regularly access "
"computers with development or virtualization capabilities."
msgstr ""

#: src/design.md:7
msgid ""
"**Minimal Prior Knowledge.** Ideally, learners should only need minimal "
"technical background to engage with the Linux Luminarium (e.g., only needing "
"to know how to use a web browser). We deliberately avoided assuming users "
"already understand file systems, processes, source code, executable files, "
"and almost all other technical concepts."
msgstr ""

#: src/design.md:9
msgid ""
"**Minimal Conceptual Span.** Considering that learners are unfamiliar with "
"the relevant concepts, we worked to decompose the Linux learning process "
"into a series of small steps that progressively accumulate to ultimately "
"form a solid and systematic understanding."
msgstr ""

#: src/design.md:11
msgid ""
"**Guardrails.** As experienced educators, we observed that learners can go "
"astray in multiple ways during the learning process. Therefore, we worked to "
"create a learning environment that allows learners to explore freely while "
"minimizing errors that deviate from the main learning path and cause "
"learning blockages."

"Based on the above objectives, we chose pwn.college's DOJO platform "
"\\[[17](references.md#ref17)\\] as the infrastructure for the Linux "
"Luminarium. DOJO provides an open-source, web-accessible Linux environment: "
"instructors can implement and deploy assignments within it; the platform "
"simultaneously provides instructors with advanced runtime and behavioral "
"instrumentation capabilities; and it can still provide security guarantees "
"when facing \"too-clever\" students to maintain the pedagogical integrity of "
"assignments. We adopted the PWN teaching philosophy inspired by "
"Capture-the-Flag (CTF) \\[[18](references.md#ref18)\\], which advocates "
"teaching continuous \"micro-concepts\" through a series of progressively "
"complex hands-on challenges. To this end, we break down complex concepts "
"into smaller constituent units and convey each unit through independent, "
"very small challenges; these challenges build upon each other, ultimately "
"constructing a progressive understanding of the overall concept. On top of "
"this platform and teaching philosophy, we further introduced multiple "
"customized innovations targeting the early Linux learning stage and "
"implemented a complete and systematic curriculum, which will be detailed "
"below."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:3
msgid ""
"The DOJO platform gives assignment authors significant control over the "
"learner’s web-accessible working environment. We used this flexibility to "
"implement a number of novel instrumentation hooks that serve as our "
"guardrails to improve student learning."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:5
msgid ""
"**Challenge randomization.** DOJO exposes an interface for running setup "
"code when a learner launches a challenge. We use this in a large number of "
"places in the Linux Luminarium, such as randomizing the location of files "
"that learners must find (e.g., to learn the find command), data to filter "
"(to practice grep), and so on."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:7
msgid ""
"We use two different forms of randomization: per-attempt (using a "
"pseudorandom number generator) and per-learner (achieved by hashing the "
"/flag file, which is stable per learner-challenge tuple), depending on the "
"specific challenge. The latter allows us to differentiate challenges between "
"learners to minimize the spread of written solutions (which reduce active "
"learning to passive learning), while the former increases challenge variety "
"in general."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:9
msgid ""
"**Shell instrumentation.** We expanded the DOJO platform (and up streamed "
"the resulting contribution) to enable hooking of a learner’s `.bashrc`, "
"allowing our challenges to customize learner shell sessions."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:11
msgid ""
"We use this, combined with bash’s rich debug capabilities, to enable "
"significant observability for the challenge of the learner’s attempts to "
"solve it. For example, when teaching paths and the cd command, we can "
"directly detect (by tracking the PWD environment variable) when a learner "
"enters the correct directory. Furthermore, by hooking each line entered into "
"the shell, we can ensure that learners properly use absolute paths (in "
"challenges that aim to teach them) versus relative paths (when the "
"curriculum moves on to that) or properly use file globbing, tab completion, "
"and so on as these concepts are taught."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:13
msgid ""
"**Command hooking.** We use the aforementioned shell instrumentation to set "
"the learner’s PATH environment variable to allow challenges to easily "
"override commands, letting us inject guardrails and feedback into the "
"commands themselves."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:15
msgid ""
"For example, when we teach advanced usage of the tee command, our tee "
"wrapper actually inspects the arguments to determine whether the learner is "
"on the right path."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:17
msgid ""
"**Error anticipation.** We have observed learners making a large number of "
"mistakes when learning Linux. A common example is case sensitivity: learners "
"unfamiliar with Computer Science might not understand that files and shell "
"variables are case-sensitive. A combination of our shell introspection, "
"command hooking, and mistake prediction allows us to preempt many of these "
"errors."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:19
msgid ""
"For example, a challenge that asks the learner to use cat to read the "
"`/flag` file would also include a /FLAG file with content informing the "
"learner of the casing mistake, a CAT command doing the same, a flag command "
"explaining that the command they want is cat, and a shell hook detecting the "
"errant attempt to execute the `/flag` file directly. Likewise, when teaching "
"how to set environment variables (e.g., NAME=VALUE), we include a VALUE "
"command (to catch the case where the learner does NAME= VALUE) and a NAME "
"command (to catch NAME = VALUE)."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:21
msgid ""
"Naturally, predicting all such errors is impossible. To remedy this, we "
"monitor interactions with our environment and voiced student frustrations on "
"our online Discord community. As we notice common mistakes made by learners, "
"we augment the error anticipation logic to catch these mistakes as well."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/instrumented-learning.md:23
msgid ""
"**Integrity and robustness.** Our curriculum involves some security relevant "
"concepts and, once users learn these concepts, it becomes difficult to "
"prevent them from finding unintended solutions (and thus potentially missing "
"the pedagogical point of the challenge). We expanded DOJO to try to head off "
"such solutions. For example, we use bash’s debug capabilities to hook and "
"immediately terminate sub shells, as so:"

#: src/design/capturing-flags.md:3
msgid ""
"The DOJO platform is inspired by \"Capture The Flag\" (CTF) competitions, "
"which are typically live cybersecurity events in which participants must "
"exploit hacking challenges (e.g., by exploiting them) to retrieve a "
"cryptographic \"flag\" token and submit it for points. These events are very "
"popular in the cybersecurity community, and have been observed to be "
"effective tools in the educator's toolbox \\[[7](../references.md#ref7), "

msgid ""
"Each challenge is essentially equivalent to an auto-grading script that "
"implicitly checks a learner’s solution (whether actively, such as checking "
"if the learner has cded into a specified directory, or passively, by being "
"written in a way that the user can only retrieve the flag by solving the "
"challenge). In an example of the former, the first time paths are taught, "
"the Linux Luminarium instruments the shell to detect when a learner enters "
"the correct directory, at which point it prints the flag. For the latter, "
"when we teach the chmod command for changing file permissions, the learner "
"must chmod the flag file to read the flag."
msgstr ""

"Our application of the PWN philosophy to Linux education resulted in 108 "
"challenges across 15 sub-modules. Each sub-module consists of 3 to 13 "
"challenges, and each challenge explores one micro-concept, building up in "
"aggregate to imbue the learner with Linux knowledge."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/the-curriculum.md:5
msgid ""
"Our curriculum starts out with challenges that use a heavily instrumented "
"shell session to explain the concept of Linux commands and arguments from a "
"syntactic perspective (e.g., having the user run toy commands for practice). "
"The next module introduces the Linux filesystem and the cd command to "
"explore it. Each type of path (absolute paths, “naked” (no ./) and non-naked "
"relative paths), is explored in its own challenge or series of challenges, "
"minimizing the concepts conveyed per challenge. The next module explores a "
"number of commands to help the learner start actually using the command line "
"(ls, etc.). Then the Linux Luminarium covers the reading and search of "
"documentation (using functionality of man, help, and `–help` flags). After "
"this, we cover a series of increasingly complex topics such as file "
"globbing, piping, setting and reading shell variables, and manipulating "
"data. Then aspects of the Linux operating system itself are introduced: "
"processes, permissions, users, and scripts. Finally, the curriculum ends on "
"a series of culminating experiences, described below."
msgstr ""

"The PWN philosophy suggests that approaching concepts from an "
"adversarial/security mindset enables unique insights into those concepts "
"\\[[18](../references.md#ref18)\\]. We struggled adopting this part of the "
"philosophy for much of the Linux Luminarium, as the concepts were simply too "
"introductory to even discuss security. However, toward the end of the "
"curriculum, after covering the topics described above, opportunities begin "
"to arise, and we are able to use a series of security challenges to "
"reinforce the concepts we’d previously taught.Specifically, these are:"
msgstr ""

#: src/design/the-curriculum.md:9
msgid ""
"**Cracking account passwords.** To drive home the concept of users and "
"permissions, we have a series of challenges where learners must crack "
"passwords of users created by the challenge. This is a fairly standard part "
"of a Linux security curriculum but sets the stage for more advanced "
"challenges."

"**PATH hijack.** To convey how Linux finds programs to invoke, we teach "

"common utilities and gain control of program execution (to retrieve the "
"`/flag` file)."
msgstr ""

#: src/design/the-curriculum.md:13
msgid ""
"**.bashrc hijack.** To explore implications of incorrect file permissions, "
"we have a series of challenges in which learners can hijack other user "
"accounts by exploiting unsafe permissions to hijack the victim user’s "
".bashrc. This explores, through several challenges, bad file (`.bashrc`) "
"permissions, the implications of unsafe directory permissions (e.g., "
"world-writable home directory), and the effects of unsafe handling of "
"symbolic links. We observed, and learners reported, that this improved both "
"understanding of and passion for the material."

"**Linux destruction.** Mistakes, though we try to minimize them throughout "
"the rest of the Linux Luminarium, are often the best teacher. Most Linux "
"veterans have, at some point, deleted something they did not mean to, "
"overwhelmed their machine with errant processes, and so on. Observing the "
"teaching potential of this, we created a series of challenges at the end of "
"the curriculum in which learners intentionally carry out these “mistakes” to "

"Linux Luminarium is not the first attempt to create a platform via which to "

"educators and enthusiasts alike. These Linux education resources fall into "
"two categories: interactive and non interactive. A plethora of "
"non-interactive resources have been developed to teach Linux. These take the "
"form of organized lessons \\[[21](references.md#ref21)\\], textbooks "
"\\[[8](references.md#ref8), [13](references.md#ref13)\\], video collections, "
"and countless Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). All of these tend to take "
