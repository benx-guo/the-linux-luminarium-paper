# Abstract

Learning Linux typically involves high initial setup costs, creating a paradox in practice: beginners often must already possess some understanding of the Linux environment before they can effectively begin learning it. To address this challenge, we developed an online interactive learning curriculum with the core design goal of eliminating the learning barriers imposed by manual configuration. Our approach breaks down Linux core concepts into small, focused challenge tasks, enabling learners to achieve progressive mastery through active practice. Beyond traditional exercises, the curriculum introduces deliberately designed "unconventional" and even destructive learning scenarios, such as simulating system security intrusions, deploying `forkbomb`, and executing "high-risk" commands like `rm -rf /`, deepening understanding of system behavior through intense contrasting experiences. These "shenanigan challenges" not only strengthen learners' technical capabilities but also allow them to intuitively recognize the systemic consequences of erroneous operations, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the Linux environment's flexibility, power, and potential risks, significantly enhancing the engagement and immersion of the learning process.
