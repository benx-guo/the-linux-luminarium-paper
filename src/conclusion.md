# Conclusion

The Linux Luminarium is a novel, turnkey, challenge-based Linux education platform that supercharges learners to become proficient Linux users. Over the year of its open availability, the Linux Luminarium has taught Linux to 15,394 learners, shepherding them through solving 697,553 challenges. By surveying learners around the country as well as at our University, we show that the Linux Luminarium, and the techniques that underpin it, successfully drive student learning. The Linux Luminarium is both openly available on the internet for turnkey learning and open source to enable reproducibility, learning, and ongoing research.
