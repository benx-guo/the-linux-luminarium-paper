# Introduction

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The learning journey in computer science education often needs to start from the fundamentals of the computing environment. Different educational institutions make varying choices for their environments: some standardize on Windows, others on Linux, and still others adopt emerging web technologies that allow students to proceed without mastering an operating system.

The majority of our university's computer science curriculum expects students to possess Linux knowledge, yet prior to this work, our curriculum lacked any systematic Linux education. The absence of structured Linux instruction permeated and constrained students throughout their computer science learning journey [[12](references.md#ref12)], while also significantly increasing the burden on teaching staff—fundamental understanding issues that should have been resolved early were only discovered late in the coursework.

This paper introduces a novel platform we developed to address this problem: the Linux Luminarium. Inspired by the rise of a new paradigm in cybersecurity education in 2024 [[17](references.md#ref17)], we designed and implemented the Linux Luminarium, a turnkey, well-structured, challenge-driven Linux learning platform. The Linux Luminarium contains 108 challenges distributed across 15 subject modules, with content ranging from learning command-line concepts to advanced exploration of the Linux security model.

To maximize learning effectiveness, the Linux Luminarium introduces multiple innovative features not found in other Linux education platforms, including deep shell-based instrumentation mechanisms that provide real-time guidance and feedback during the learning process; support mechanisms that identify and correct errors in real-time before learners experience frustration; and challenge randomization to promote continuous exploration of Linux concepts.

We opened the Linux Luminarium to the public on May 1, 2024. As of July 1, 2025, the platform has provided learning support to 15,394 learners (including both students from our university and external users) and has cumulatively completed 697,553 challenges. We also deployed the Linux Luminarium as an instructional module in a required junior-year computer science course at our university. According to observational feedback from the teaching process, Linux-related learning issues in subsequent coursework have significantly decreased.

To evaluate the educational effectiveness of the Linux Luminarium, we conducted two surveys (both reviewed by our Institutional Review Board and determined to be Exempt). One survey collected feedback from 47 external learners, while the other was directed at 405 junior-year computer science students at our university. The results from both surveys consistently demonstrate that the Linux Luminarium is an effective teaching tool, not only addressing the frustration learners commonly experienced when learning Linux prior to using the Linux Luminarium, but also significantly improving their Linux-related knowledge levels. Additionally, the survey results indicate that the innovative design elements we proposed played a critical role in achieving these outcomes.

Our goal is to make the Linux Luminarium an important entry platform for learners worldwide who are interested in Linux as they begin their computing learning journey. To achieve this goal, the Linux Luminarium is freely available to all users, and all platform components are released as open source, enabling the community to continuously advance research and development on this foundation.
