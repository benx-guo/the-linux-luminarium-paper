# Impact and Results

We opened the Linux Luminarium to the world on May 1, 2024, relying on word of mouth to spread awareness. We have continued to add new challenges exploring new concepts over time, resulting in 108 challenges across 15 sub-modules.

The usage has gradually increased over time. Until this paper's data cutoff of July 1, 2025, a total of 15,394 have solved 697,553 challenges, with June 2025 seeing 55,363 solves by 1,946 learners.

To understand the impact of Linux Luminarium on learners, we carried out two surveys[^1] : one for students at our University, where we use the Linux Luminarium as a Linux primer for Computer Science majors (mostly in their Junior year) and another for learners from around the United States, beyond our university. Our surveys included both Likert scale and free response questions. All questions in both surveys were optional.

In analyzing the survey data, we identified a number of takeaways that demonstrate the strengths, impact, and weaknesses of the Linux Luminarium, which we detail below.
