# Learners at our University

The Linux Luminarium is a required module during the Introduction to Cybersecurity course at our large R1 public University. At the conclusion of every module, including the Linux Luminarium, we invited students to complete a survey about their experience with the material. Because these surveys exist after each module, they are not Linux-specific, and so are structured differently than the survey discussed earlier. Of the 658 students in the class, 405 filled out the survey and consented to be included in this study[^1].

Students reported working an average of 11.23 hours to complete the module. Additionally, students overwhelmingly agreed that the Linux Luminarium was Educational (388 agreeing vs 27 disagreeing), Enjoyable (388 vs 49), and Engaging (360 vs 37), and that the challenge descriptions helped students learn the material (322 vs 24).

In free-form responses, students listed as positives, from most frequently listed to least frequently listed, the following:
- The CTF-style challenge gamification.
- Gradual, step-by-step challenges that keep learners engaged and reinforce concepts.
- Increased comfort with Linux over the course of the module.
- Available help from Discord, Generative AI, and shell instrumentation to fill the gaps left by the challenge descriptions.
- The quality of the challenge descriptions themselves.
- The ease of web accessibility of the Linux Luminarium environment.

The negatives, from most frequently listed to least frequently listed (omitting course-specific feedback such as Canvas organization, etc.), were:
- Vague, confusing, rambling, or incomplete challenge descriptions.
- Residual hard-to-bridge conceptual gaps between some of the challenges, with data piping (between processes), file globbing, symbolic links, and the security implications of the PATH environment variable specifically mentioned.
- Overly-repetitive challenge ramps (e.g., too much practice for concepts such as chmod).

Anecdotally, we found that the introduction of the Linux Luminarium during the 2024-2025 academic year drastically improved student understanding of Linux throughout the rest of the course. Whereas prior iterations of this course would receive introductory questions from students (e.g., about the Linux filesystem layout, the Linux process model, etc.), we observed almost no such questions in either semester that included the Linux Luminarium.
