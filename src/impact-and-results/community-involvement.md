# Community Involvement

Because the Linux Luminarium is openly available and open source, and the material is intentionally very introductory, passionate learners are able to contribute to the project. Over the roughly 14 months of its availability, we have received contributions from 15 distinct individuals from the global community. These contributions ranged from spelling and grammar fixes to entire sub-modules of content. For example, the Linux Luminarium's file permissions module was initially contributed by a community member.
